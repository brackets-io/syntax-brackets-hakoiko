Hakoiko Theme for Brackets
=========

Inspired from tumblr.com Html editor. and added some light effects with CSS3. 

basicially, HTML shows you green + gray. JS is yellow + orange. CSS is combined with blue + gray + green + orange. so you can easilly know document type that you see now. even if you didn't read the syntax.
